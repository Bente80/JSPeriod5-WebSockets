 *
 * 10. Explain and demonstrate “three-way data binding” using Firebase and Angular
 *
 * Three-way synchronization between Firebase and your application’s View and Model in Angular is the easiest way to build collaborative,
 * multi-user applications.
 * AngularJS is known for its two-way data binding between models in JavaScript and the DOM. Changes in the view are automatically
 * reflected in the model, and vice versa. Developers don’t have to worry about writing code to synchronize the view and the model or
 * manipulate the DOM.
 * By syncing your Angular model with Firebase, your app’s data in the model is synchronized in real-time across all clients.
 * When data changes in one client, those updates are immediately persisted to Firebase and rendered across all clients.

08. What is Backend as a Service, Database as a Service, why would you consider using Firebase in your
    projects?

Backend as a Service, or BaaS (sometimes referred to as mBaaS) is a cloud computing category that consists of companies that make it
easier for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile, tablet and web apps.
Backend as a Service provides web and mobile app developers with a way to link their applications to backend cloud storage while also
providing features such as user management, push notifications, and integration with social networking services. These services are
provided through customized Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

Database as a Service (DBaaS) is a cloud-based approach to the storage and management of structured data.
DBaaS delivers database functionality similar to what is found in relational database management systems (RDBMSes) such as SQL Server,
MySQL and Oracle. Being cloud-based, on the other hand, DBaaS provides a flexible, scalable, on-demand platform that's oriented toward
self-service and easy management, particularly in terms of provisioning a business' own environment. DBaaS products typically provide
enough monitoring capabilities to track performance and usage and to alert users to potential issues. The products can also generate
at least some degree of data analytics.

Firebase is an API to store and sync data in realtime, helping developers build realtime apps.
You can save data, update data, and listen for data changes in realtime with only a few lines of code.
Firebase is a realtime database, simular to nosql, which provides an API that allows developers to store and sync data across multiple
clients. The data is saved as standard JSON objects.
The Firebase company provides client libraries that enable integration with Android, iOS, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C and Node.js
applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS,
React, Ember.js and Backbone.js. The REST API uses the Server-Sent Events protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for
receiving push notifications from a server.
Firebase also has safety and security built in.
Firebase is a service, you create an account, and log in. This means that you dont have to care about scalability.

The reason to use firebase are:

Firebase provides three key services that enable you to build rich, full-featured applications using just client-side code:

1. A realtime data API. Our API replaces the need for most backend databases and server code by handling the heavy lifting of data storage
   and synchronization.

2. User management and authentication. Our Simple Login service handles your user management and authentication needs out-of-the-box. Or,
   if you prefer to manage users yourself, you can maintain complete control using Custom Login.

3. Hosting. With hosting, you can deploy your static website to the internet with a single command.

* All of these services are built for security, reliability, and scale, so you can deploy your applications with confidence.

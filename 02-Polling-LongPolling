02. Explain polling and long-polling strategies, their pros and cons.

Polling is the process where the computer or controlling device waits for an external device to check for its readiness
or state, often with low-level hardware. For example, when a printer is connected via a parallel port, the computer
waits until the printer has received the next character. These processes can be as minute as only reading one bit.

In networks, polling is used to determine which nodes want to access the network. It is also used by routing protocols
to retrieve routing information, as is the case with EGP (exterior gateway protocol).

+ The main advantage of polling is that the CPU determines how often it needs to poll. An interrupt causes the CPU
  to "stop" and determine what device is interrupting.
+ If the CPU can be late handling the device, then polling prevents the CPU from being interrupted.
- The problem with polling is that the CPU operates at a much faster speed than most I/O devices. Thus, a CPU can get
 into a busy wait, checking the device many times, even though the device is very slow.
- Polling do though require the devices to be quick.

Long polling is a variation of the traditional polling technique.
With long polling, the client requests information from the server exactly as in normal polling, but with the expectation
the server may not respond immediately. If the server has no new information for the client when the poll is received,
instead of sending an empty response, the server holds the request open and waits for response information to become
available. Once it does have new information, the server immediately sends an HTTP/S response to the client, completing
the open HTTP/S Request.

+ Long polling allows emulating a push mechanism under circumstances where a real push is not possible, such as sites
  with security policies that require rejection of incoming HTTP/S Requests.
- The server does not immediately respond but waits until there's new information available.

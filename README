Period-5 WebSockets/Real time communication

By Bente Andersen

This file is meant to give you an overview of this hand in. I will make one file for each question, but the example
code for this hand in will come from one git-hub repositories I have made.

I have put in examples of the code in some of the questions, but they wonÂ´t work here. In some of the examples I have
linked to a repository where you can see how the code works. Below you will find a link to that repository.

The repository is named:

JSPeriod5-WebSocketChat3 -     https://github.com/Bente80/JS-05-WebSocketChat

The Links to where I have found inspiration fore the answers will be in each file.

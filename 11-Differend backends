11. Explain and demonstrate the difference between the simple chat system in your own WebSocket + Node.js
    backend vs. Firebase.

The difference between the simple chat system in your own WebSocket + Node.js backend vs. Firebase is that you in firebase on top you
can store the data on an online database very easialy. Furthermore using firebase doesÂ´nt require the app to have a backend, as the
data is stored in there. With Firebase you are able to receive many little messages instead of downloading big chunks of data (this
improves reactiveness of you app!)

As you can see we have the whole backend via Express setup with our own chat system - and via socket.io we create the socket connection
for communication. We can then store the data in a MongoDB for persistence.
With a threeway databinding chat it is only the angular frontend and all backend and persistence is done via Firebase.

You can see a simple chat system if you look at my github link:

Explain the pros & cons of using a Backend as a Service Provider like Firebase.

+ Firebase is hosted on their server.
+ If your app does run of a centralized DB, and is updated by a lot of users - then it's more than capable of handling the Real-Time
  data updates between devices.
+ Stored in the cloud so readily available everywhere.
+ Cross Platform API (If you are using this DB with an App)
+ They Host the data. -Meaning if you are storing a lot of data, you don't have to worry about hardware!
+ Autoscaling built-in
+ Can start for free (only need to start paying once we hit 50 connections)
+ Robust APIs for Javascript (including several frameworks like Angular), iOS, and Android
+ Built-in support for authentication services like Facebook, Google, and Twitter
+ Declarative Security Rules model allows us to enforce read/write privileges and data validation throughout the tree

- You canÂ´t modifi everything, because there are several pagages that are made forehand.
- Unless your app runs of one centralized database updated by a vast quantity of users, it's a major overkill.
- Storage format is entirely different to that of SQL, (Firebase uses JSON) so you wouldn't be able to migrate that easily.
- Reporting tools won't be anywhere near the ones of standard SQL.
- Costs! -Limited to 50 Connections and 100mb of Storage!
- You don't host the data, Firebase does. And depending on which server you get put on, viewing there up time there seems to be a lot
  of disruption lately.
- Need to build indexes manually
- May need to build "event log" manually as well (in separate sub-tree?)
- Implementation of REST API could be difficult on embedded platforms
- Data validation rules do not support complex objects directly (you'd need to validate individual child nodes separately)
